Welcome to a completely new re-write of the [react-native-ui-stepper](https://github.com/hannigand/react-native-ui-stepper) library. This version is **NOT** backwards capatiable, but it's more flexible and stable than the previous.

### Why?

Within a year of being published, this library has been downloaded more than [8500 times](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=react-native-ui-stepper). The library included a very rigid API and lacked any quality control. Now, you have all of the control over what's being rendered, backed by a comprehensive test suite to give you reassurance.
